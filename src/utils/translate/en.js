We are the first café of its kind in Jalisco, a unique space where you can enjoy handcrafted drinks and delicious desserts while spending time with adorable cats. Our environment is designed to be comfortable, warm, and relaxing for both our visitors and our feline friends.",
    SOBRE_NOSOTROS_TT1: "Our Story",
    SOBRE_NOSOTROS_STT1: "Neko-Hi officially opened its doors on April 9, 2019, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, after months of planning, searching for the perfect location, and preparing health protocols to welcome the first five kitties, who would become the stars of the café. Inspired by Japanese cat cafés, we decided to bring that concept to our city with the goal of offering a space where people could relax, bond with cats, and—why not?—consider adopting one. Despite the challenges, including the pandemic, the love from our community allowed us to move forward. In October 2021, we expanded to welcome more visitors and give a home to more kittens. Today, 10 happy cats live in the café, and we hope that number continues to grow.",
